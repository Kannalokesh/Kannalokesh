# üëã Hi, I‚Äôm Lokesh Junjoor
An aspiring AI researcher and software developer passionate about leveraging machine learning and artificial intelligence to solve real-world problems. Currently pursuing my M.Tech in Artificial Intelligence at the University of Hyderabad, I have a strong foundation in programming, data science, and deep learning.

I enjoy building practical projects ‚Äî from forecasting electricity demand with advanced regression models to creating mental health chatbots and developing medical imaging solutions using mobile neural networks. With a solid grip on Python, C, and web technologies, I‚Äôm always eager to learn, collaborate, and contribute to impactful open-source projects.

Feel free to explore my projects, profiles and connect with me!
